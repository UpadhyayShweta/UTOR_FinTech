## Overview and Origin

The National Bank of Canada was formed in November 1979 from the merger of **Provincial Bank of Canada and _Banque Canadienne Nationale(BCN)_**, foundation of which was laid down in November 1859 as **‘Banque Nationale’** by French-speaking businessmen in Ontario and Quebec who were keen to establish a bank under their local control. It is the sixth largest commercial bank in Canada, headquartered in _Montreal_ and branches in most Canadian provinces. 
Company receives it funding via Retail and commercial deposits along with wholesale funding. Wholesale funding is typically obtained directly from institutional investors in financial markets. It is largely used to finance banks’ activities in capital markets, to offer financial services to large institutional clients and to support other lending activities.   
As per the company’s [_2021 Annual report_](https://www.nbc.ca/content/dam/bnc/a-propos-de-nous/relations-investisseurs/assemblee-annuelle/2022/na-2021-annual-report.pdf), it has acquired funding of 33.8B in the Financial year of 2021,including cash flows from  operating, financial and investing activities.

## Business Scenario

Currently NBC is using SLOCs, a legal document that guarantees a bank's commitment of payment to a seller in the event that the buyer–or the bank's client–defaults on the agreement. A standby letter of credit helps facilitate international trade between companies that don't know each other and have different laws and regulations. Although the buyer is certain to receive the goods and the seller certain to receive payment, a SLOC doesn't guarantee the buyer will be happy with the goods. A standby letter of credit can also be abbreviated SBLC.
SLOCs can be defined as an _“undertaking”_.  An undertaking provides the named beneficiary with an “independent” assurance of payment from the undertaking’s issuer (issuers are most often banks). Standby letters of credit are deemed: “irrevocable” meaning they cannot be changed or cancelled prior to its stated expiry date without the agreement of all parties. Parties involved in Standby letters of credit are: Advising bank (that the beneficiary has a relationship with),
Applicant, Beneficiary, Confirmer or Confirming Bank(optional), Issuer or Issuing Bank or Opening Bank, Nominated Bank 

SBLC issuance process – direct to beneficiary or utilizing an advising bank(below)

NBC plans to leverage _smart contracts_ in order to replace current email-based procedures of issuing _SLOCs(Standby Letters of Credit)_, a complex and time consuming process often leading to errors, delays, and poor transparency. In partnership with IT and business consulting services firm **CGI** and blockchain startup **Skuchain**, NBS aims to use blockchain to combat the existing complex process and offer a simple, fast and efficient experience to it’s _commercial clients_, attributing to *0.5%* of it’s total clientele of *2.7B*, facilitating them in managing their business.

> “This project is viewed as a great opportunity to leverage blockchain technology to simplify the process for negotiating standby letters of credit and guarantees while making it more transparent and secure” ~ quoted by Patrice Roy, vice president of payments, cash management and international solutions at National Bank of Canada

NBC offers many financial services to its' client but its' unique offering of **_The NBC Family Advantage_** where it help clients which are family-controlled businesses with their capital raising, risk management and advisory needs, gave it an added advantage over its' competitors. Family‐controlled firms , accounting for about 80% of companies worldwide are a crucial pillar of the global economy. Larger public family firms have continued to thrive despite the rise of widely‐held public corporations run by professional managers. They currently represent close to a fifth of the companies in the Fortune Global 500. Moreover, the evidence indicates that large family‐controlled businesses returns have on average outperformed widely‐held companies in many countries.
As per the Family Advantage Summer 2022 report, the NBC Canadian Family Index has registered a cumulative return of 325.1% compared to 221.9% for the S&P/TSX Composite Index (9.4% compared to 7.6% in annualized terms, from June 2005 to June 2021.

## Results


With the right banking partner by your side, any challanges faced by business can be overcome. NBC is a strong supporter of SMEs and a long-time partner of the Entrepreneur Fund.
There are hundreds, if not thousands, of metrics or key performance indicators (KPIs) used by banking sector to accurately evaluate profit and operations and manage businesses more effectively. 
Top 10 KPIs are listed below:

    1. Net Interest Margin 
    2. Return on Assets 
    3. Return on Equity
    4. Loan-to-Assets Ratio 
    5. Risk-Adjusted Return on Capital 
    6. Efficiency Ratio 
    7. Loans to Deposits Ratio 
    8. Yield on Loans 
    9. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses to Loans
    10. Cost of Total Deposits

NBC is leading in all the above mentioned KPIs when compared to its' competitors in Financial services and integration of smart contracts in Payments domain will enable National Bank of Canada to provide trade finance services digitally to customers conducting business on a blockchain B2B solution. In particular, customers will be able to initiate, conduct and conclude negotiations of standby letters of credit and guarantees entirely on smart contracts that can intelligently construct agreements and securely communicate any changes in terms to relevant parties. The result is a blockchain-based contract negotiation tool that is enormously effective in the standby letter of credit and guarantee process.

## Recommendations

NBC can explore in **Demographic-focused products**. New set of companies are developing demographically-focused products. They segment not only from a brand and marketing perspective, but from a product innovation perspective as well. For example, True Link Financial’s elder fraud protections, Finhabits’ saving focus for Latino’s, Camino Financial’s lending for Latino-owned small and medium size businesses, or Ellevest’s product design for women all go beyond branding to design products from scratch with unique use cases and features in mind. Similarly, Brex offers cards tailored individually for startups, for ecommerce companies, and (reportedly) for other small business segments. 
Demographically-focused products is an emerging service which can NBC capture clients worldwide and increase it reach on global scale.
What technologies would demographic-focused product utilise? This can be achieved by using AI and machine learning. Infact the use of AI and machine learning in banking services is not new. Payment companies, for example, have been using machine learning to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions for a while, Bennett said. And as computing power and storage have increased, detection increasingly happens in real time.
Below is the list of top benefits of AI in banking and finance today:
- Reduction in operational costs and risk
- Improved customer experience
- Improved fraud detection and regulatory compliance
- Improved loan and credit decisioning
- Automation of the investment process
